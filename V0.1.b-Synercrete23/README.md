# microEMMARM
This release is meant to be a companion resource to the paper "A cost-effective micro-controller based system for EMM-ARM tests in cement paste", to be presented in the Synercrete'23 conference.

This version is identified as v.0.1.b, and is still considered a beta release.

It has some improvements in terms of documentation and code organization over the previous microEMMARM release (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5802546), but no significant changes have been made that would justify naming this a v.0.2 release. The most important addition is the release of a post-processing algorithm implemented in Python (disclosed as a Jupyter Notebook).
