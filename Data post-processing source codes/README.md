This folder contains the source codes of the software for EMM-ARM data post-processing and E-modulus estimation.

The source codes were developed in the MATLAB programming environment. Installation of the required toolboxes may be required.

The following 3 .m files were developed, and need to be subsequently manually run to perform all the post-processing tasks required during EMM-ARM data processing. 

Further improvements will aim towards building an integrated user interface for all these codes.

# 1 - Iterative frequency identification in all files (1_freqId file)

1. The code starts by asking the user to select the folder that contains all the test files.

2. The code iterates through each of the test files.

3. In each test file, the code automatically estimates the first "n" frequencies by using the peak-picking method.

4. In the beggining of the code, some configuration variables shall be set by the user: number of frequencies to be identified, digital filtering characteristics, etc.

5. The code generates a text file in which the time and frequency of each test file is printed in a space-separated file

# 2 - Iterative E-modulus estimation from the identified frequency in all files (2_EModEst file)

1. The code reads the result text file generated by the previous code and estimates the E-modulus from each natural frequency.

2. The code iterates through each line of the results text file and estimates the E-modulus.

3. In the beggining of the code, some configuration variables and input information are required: specimen length, mass at the tip, empty natural frequency of the mould and its length during the empty test for estimation of the mould's material E-modulus, etc.

4. The code generates a results text file in which the time and E-modulus associated to each test file is printed in a space-seprated file.

# 3 - E-modulus curve fitting in the identified E-modulus (3_EModCurveFit file)

1. The code fits the following curve to the E-modulus results obtained from the results text file generated by the previous code

2. The code generates a result file that contains the information about the fitted curve (value of the parameters and the R2 value) and the values of the fitted curve at each tested point, with the residuals at each point.
