# microEMMARM
This is the official repository of the microEMMARM system. Punctual static releases made available in Zenodo will also be archived here.

Thi built and will be maintaned to provide all the necessary resources to deploy a microEMMARM test system and perform an EMM-ARM test with it.

This repository will constantly be updated for bug fixes, new versions and other updates/fixes. Keep an eye on it!
