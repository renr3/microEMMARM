# microEMMARM
This is the official repository of the microEMMARM system. 

This repository was built and will be maintaned to provide all the necessary resources to deploy the open-source microEMMARM test system and perform an EMM-ARM test with it. This repository will constantly be updated for bug fixes, new versions and other updates/fixes. **Keep an eye on it!**

The microEMMARM project is released under MIT license. If you want to use for commercial ends, please check the restrictions imposed by the licenses that bind this work (both microEMMARM and the libraries that it uses). 

Punctual static releases made available in Zenodo will also be archived here.

If you are  interested in more details, explanation and results concerning the microEMMARM system, please check the papers below. Also, if you use this repository in some way, please consider citing a research paper that reports on this work:
