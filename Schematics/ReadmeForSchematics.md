These schematics were developed in the Fritzing software (https://fritzing.org/).

Eagle files generated from the Fritzing software are also included.

Some components of the system are currently designed for future upgrades and require more testing so they can be considered as fully functional. One may possible reduce the current design to a bare minimum by removing unused digital channels, capacitors and ADC channels. The cost reduction, however, shall be negligible.

For first time builders, it is recommended to follow the schematics in a solderless breadboard, or on a soldered perfboard, so a better understanding of the circuit is attained. For experienced users in electronics, the Eagle files may be used to directly print a PCB board.
