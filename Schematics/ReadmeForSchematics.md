These schematics were developed in the Fritzing software (https://fritzing.org/).

Eagle files generated from the Fritzing software are also included.

For first time builders, it is recommended to follow the schematics in a solderless breadboard, or on a soldered perfboard, so a better understanding of the circuit is attained. For experienced users in electronics, the Eagle files may be used to directly print a PCB board.

The microEMMARM schematics currently have the following versions:

- v0.0: this is the bare-minimum version, as shown in the Figure 3 of the research paper "Low-cost system for early age E-modulus monitoring of cement-based materials"
- v0.1: this is the bare-minimum version with added ADC channels and digital channels for controlling external devices through a digital interface (e.g. motors for artificial excitation). This version is still under testing and is reported on the conference pappers of "XXXXX" and "XXXXX"
