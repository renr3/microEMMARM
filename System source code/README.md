This folder contains the Arduino source code files required by the microprocessor to perform the automated tasks. 

In order to open the file and upload to the Arduino or to a properly bootloaded microprocessor, the user shall use the latest version of the Arduino IDE.

Installation of the libraries used by the source code may be required during uploading the source code.

The source code folders are named to indicate the respective hardware version they were built upon. Make sure you use the correct one, otherwise your system may not function well or may not function at all.
